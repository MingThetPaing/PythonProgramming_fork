Subject: Consent to Publish our Team Video on your YouTube Channel

Dear Professor ,

I am writing on behalf of group 3 to provide consent for the publication of a video featuring our team on your YouTube channel. We appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with you and showcase our work to a wider audience. We understand that by publishing the video on your YouTube channel, it will be accessible to the public.

We confirm that all team members featured in the video have provided their consent for its publication. We also grant permission to mention the names of the individual team members (Ming Thet Paing, Pone Nyet Aung, Naing Lin Thu, Eaint Thet Hmu) in the video.

Thank you for your continued support in promoting our collaborative efforts. We look forward to seeing the video on your YouTube channel.

If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours sincerely,

Group 3
